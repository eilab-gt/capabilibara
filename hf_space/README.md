## Overview

This Space provides an interactive interface for exploring **Capability Provenance in Language Models: A Case Study in Social Reasoning** (COLM 2026).

The pipeline maps which regions of pretraining text (Dolma3 stratified into WebOrganizer's 24×24 topic-by-format taxonomy) support social vs. STEM reasoning, validated with targeted unlearning.

### Features
- **Matrix Explorer**: Browse 576 corpus bins across 24 topics and 24 formats.
- **Influence Breakdown**: Compare signed influence across SocialIQA, MMLU Social Sciences, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU STEM.
- **Paper & Citation**: Access the arXiv paper, bibtex, and repository details.
